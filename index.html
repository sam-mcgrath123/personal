          I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and a
          minor in cyber security at Iowa State University. During my time at
          Iowa State, I have been elected as a resident hall president, competed
          in three hackathons/coding competitions, won a state competition for
          the CFA Research Challenge, selected as a freshman member to the ISU
          Wall Street Club, attended events hosted by the Computer Science Club,
          participated as a captain for an intramural softball team and
          participated in intramural basketball and volleyball. While I
          prioritize academics, I enjoy participating in extracurricular
          activities.

            Computer Science 309 is a course at Iowa State where students are
            tasked with creating an app over the course of a semester. I started
            this project after I finished that class because, with deadlines to
            meet for the class, it wasn't possible to really understand the best
            practices for mobile app development and get up to speed with newer
            technologies that have made android development more efficient. By
            using the app my team and I made during our fall semester of 2022 as
            a model, I'm attempting to completely rework the design of both the
            front end and backend to eventually build a fitness app that could
            be realistically used.
